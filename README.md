# Equality

Equality for [Occam](https://occam.science).

This package includes private lemmas in order to demonstrate that the verifier's equational system is capable of proving that equality is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
Inequality is also defined with axioms to enabe its equivalence to the negation of equality.
